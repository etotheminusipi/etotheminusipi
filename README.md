- 👋 Hi, I’m @etotheminusipi, a.k.a. Tim.
- 👀 I’m interested in data science with python with an eye toward medical imaging processing for neuroscience.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all I can about "data science" through DataCamp, Udemy, and texts for the most part. (I have completed the DataCamp Data Scientist career track.)  
- 🤞  I am also learning github as I go (this is me sticking my toe in the water). This is not my day job, so slow and steady is my mantra.
